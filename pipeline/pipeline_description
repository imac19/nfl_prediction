The files here are set up so that the entire pipeline can be run end to end. It's going to be set up with a series of variables that can be adjusted, this way the pipeline can be run multiple times with different variables and the results can be compared. Ideally, the pipeline is mostly going to be used to look at end results, since its going to be built using regular python files and thus wont print out many details throughout the run. For detailed analysis and testing, we want to refer to the ipynb files in the rest of the repo, and then once we have a finalized code it can be moved to the pipeline.
